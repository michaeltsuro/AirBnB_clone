#### Starting the Commandline Interpreter
The Commandline Interpreter can be started by executing the command `./console.py`. The `console` can `create`, `destroy`, and `update` objects. Type `help` within the console to get a list of command options and its function.

**Example:**
```bash
user@ubuntu:~$ ./console.py
(hbnb) help

Documented commands (type help <topic>):
========================================
EOF  create  help  quit

Undocumented commands:
======================
all  destroy  show  update

(hbnb) help quit
Quit command to exit the program
(hbnb) quit
user@ubuntu:~$
```
